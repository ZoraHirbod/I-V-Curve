# I-V-Curve
The code is written for Keithley source meter 2400. 
With this LabView code, you can apply a controlled voltage to a system (e.g. metal stripe), and we measure the injected current and resistance. We can control
the applied voltage increased by setting the steps. The duration of each step can be set, too.
